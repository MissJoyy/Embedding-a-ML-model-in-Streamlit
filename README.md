# Embedding-a-ML-model-in-Streamlit
# ML Model Integration Project - README

## Project Overview

This project explains how to integrate a Machine Learning (ML) model into a web application. By building a user-friendly interface, users can easily input data, run predictions using the ML model, and view the results. The primary goal is to use **Streamlit** to develop an interactive web app that communicates with the ML model, processes user inputs, and displays predictions in real time.

## Key Objectives

- Build a web interface using **Streamlit** to interact with an ML model.
- Process user input, submit the data to the model, and display predictions.
- Create a dashboard to visualize data from a database.
- Document your process in an article and publish it on Medium.

## Project Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Users can input values through the web app.
- **Backend Integration**: Inputs are processed and submitted to the ML model for prediction.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Predictions are displayed back to the user on the interface.
- **Dashboard Visualization**: A dashboard to visualize and explore the data from a database.
- **Documentation**: Publish an article on Medium documenting your project development.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Build the Streamlit App

1. **Set up Streamlit**: Install Streamlit in your environment.
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit
    ```
2. **Integrate ML Model**: Embed the classification model you developed earlier into the app:
   - Create an input form to accept data from users.
   - Process the input data in the backend.
   - Pass the data to the ML model for predictions.
   - Display the predictions on the web interface.

### Step 2: Create a Data Visualization Dashboard

- Develop a dashboard within the Streamlit app to display visual insights from the dataset.
  - Include summary statistics and interactive visualizations like charts and graphs.
  - Allow users to interact with and explore the data.

### Step 3: Write and Publish an Article on Medium

- Document the steps you followed to build the web app and integrate the ML model.
- Discuss the challenges and insights gained from the project.
- Publish your article on Medium to share your learnings with the community.
